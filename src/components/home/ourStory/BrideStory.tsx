          Our love story could easily be tagged unconventional. Sughnen and I
          went to Bingham University together. However, we met through a mutual
          friend (Barry). It was one of those nights in Bingham, I and a friend
          needed to get food and were heading out to meet Barry because dinner
          was on him that night as we were broke. Barry had come with a friend,
          Sughnen. I and my friend exchanged pleasantries with Barry and headed
          off to buy food. We came back to Barry and his friend to return change
          as this was the period that everyone was broke. I realised we'd not
          said hi to his "boring" friend and then I said, "good night, friend"
          and he said, "good night, friend" as well. <br />
          <br />I remember the 13 of June, 2015 like it was only yesterday. An
          unknown number called and it turned out to be Suggy. He'd called to
          comfort me over the loss of Barry's dad (may his soul continue to rest
          in peace) We continued talking and later that night, met up and my
          God, we talked extensively. We clicked. To think I'd thought of him as
          boring, I realized rather quickly that he was far from boring...
          Sughnen and I continued to talk. We spent time getting to know each
          other as well. School came to a close and we went to our various
          homes. <br />
          <br />
          One day, I asked what we were doing and he went on to ask if I'd be
          his girl friend? I never said yes,I just giggled.The 16th of July,
          2015, we put a tag to it and it became official. This was the
          beginning of our journey together proper. We've had our fair share of
          ups and downs as many relationships do. However, we worked through our
          differences and never gave up on each other. We argued and disagreed
          but we never let our fights last. The Bible does emphasis on not
          letting the sun go down whilst you're angry (Ephesians 4:26.) This we
          made sure of. Being angry and acting on it by not speaking to each
          other was not an option. <br />
          <br />
          On the 30th of June, 2019 I had my graduation Thanksgiving after which
          I went out to dinner with my friends. Suggy had planned a dinner at
          Honey to host my friends and I because Bingham had scrapped dinner off
          our graduation activities. Well that was the reason he'd given. I was
          at dinner with the closest people to myself and Sughnen and we were in
          a celebratory mode because we'd just graduated. Everyone's food had
          started to come out. Wilson got his and I was whingeing about why I'd
          not gotten mine to Suggy and he urged me to be patient. Lo and behold,
          my food came. <br />
          <br />I was wondering why it was covered up compared to everyone else
          that got served. Upon opening my "meal" I read the words, "will you
          marry me Kucheli?" I was over the moon. Suggy is everything and more.
          Just what I prayed for. I said yes! <br />
          <br />I said yes because Sughnen is my best friend, he's kind, loving,
          gentle, smart, very neat ,handsome,ambitious ,determined and he is
          just my vibe (Vibes don’t lie ) . I could go on and on. Above all,
          he's a God fearing man and this is pivotal to me as I want a family
          that is grounded in Christ. Imagine finding both love and friendship
          in one person. I want our marital realities to be happier than our
          pre-wedding shots. I promise to pray for you and what we got daily.{" "}
