          Your love came to me as a blessing in disguise at a time when I was so
          lucky to realize this, if it were in 2020 then I would say your love
          wore a mask which made it a bit hard recognize but guess what, love
          conquerors all. Faith brought Kuchy and I together I would say through
          a mutual friend which at the time was passing through some
          difficulties but God uses some situations to lead us to our fortune
          and that is you my sunrise.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our time together in school felt like family away from home as I
          remember you remained a shoulder for me to cry on and comforter at my
          difficult moments especially during my final exams and Project (Wink),
          the best moments will never fade away as we grew in love at heart,
          then came the question which struck hard “What are we?” am sorry If I
          ever took what we shared for granted, you are everything to me and I
          never seemed to know how best to answer this question when it came out
          but I could manage to ask if you would be my woman. <br />
          <br />
          You also could not answer at the blink of it but your eyes wrote an
          epistle of a future for us, your actions with love, honestly, faith,
          consistently builds us, at times when I could not even imagine and my
          Heart and lips would only say “there goes my baby!” We have had our
          fair share of arguments, disagreements but we still wax even stronger
          and to me it’s a strong sign of our love as we strive to be better
          partners every other day. <br />
          <br />I never got a befitting way or opportunity to ask you to be my
          wife, am sorry I found a straight way to your heart through your
          sumptuous plate of food (Wink Emoji) and thank you for accepting to
          deal with my flaws. I promise to love, Cherish and respect you forever
          and a day more!! <br />
          <br />I LOVE YOU MY SUNRISE (MY SHAN PEPE)
