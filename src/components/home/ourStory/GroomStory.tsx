          Your love came to me as a blessing in disguise at a time when I was so
          lucky to realize this. If it were in 2020, I would say your love wore
          a mask which made it a bit hard recognize but guess what, love
          conquerors all! Faith brought Kuchy and I together through a mutual
          friend which at the time was passing through some difficulties but God
          used some situations to lead us to our fortune and that is you my
          sunrise.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our time together in school felt like family away from home as I
          remember you remained a shoulder for me to cry on and a comforter in
          my difficult moments especially during my final exams and project
          üòâ. The best moments will never fade away as we grew in love at
          heart. Then came the question which struck hard ‚ÄúWhat are we?‚Äù I'm
          sorry If I ever took what we shared for granted. You are everything to
          me and I never seemed to know how best to answer this question when it
          came but I could manage to ask if you would be my woman. <br />
          <br />
          You also could not answer at the blink of it but your eyes wrote an
          epistle of a future for us. Your actions with love, honestly and faith
          consistently builds us even at times I could not even imagine. My
          heart and lips would only say ‚Äúthere goes my baby!‚Äù. We have had our
          fair share of arguments and disagreements but we still wax even
          stronger and to me it‚Äôs a strong sign of our love as we strive to be
          better partners every other day. <br />
          <br />I never got a befitting way or opportunity to ask you to be my
          wife. I'm sorry I found a straight way to your heart through your
          sumptuous plate of food üòâ. <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for accepting to deal with my flaws. <br />
          <br />I promise to love, Cherish and respect you forever and a day
          more!! <br />
          <br />I LOVE YOU MY SUNRISE (MY SHAN PEPE)
