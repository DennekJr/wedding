          Love, a word with just four letters but so powerful it brings two
          different worlds together. A word very easy to pronounce but has the
          power to make all your differences be denounced and put aside. <br />
          <br />
          Kuch and Sughnen, I have watched you both prove the power of this word
          called love to each other. I have watched you both accept the sweet
          part and overcome the bitter aspect of it, coming out stronger than
          ever. <br />
          <br />
          As you are about to start your forever, the stereotype about marriage
          not being easy will be something you both will never relate to. May
          your love speak a million things to your hearts without having to
          utter a word. May you run through each other‚Äôs mind for the rest of
          your lives without getting weak or tired. <br />
          <br />I am glad you both were never afraid to fall deep. <br />
          <br />
          Congrats my beautiful people.
